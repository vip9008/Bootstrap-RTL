# Bootstrap-RTL
This is a simple css file to change original bootstrap.css to RTL (built on Bootstrap v3.3.5)

# How to use:
Just include bootstrap_rtl.css after the original bootstrap.css file.

# What changes will be done to the original?
- All bootstrap grid classes (col-xs-?, col-sm-?, col-md-?, col-lg-?) will be float: right; instead of float: left;
- push and pull classes will be RTL oriented.
- offset classes will be from right to left.

THATS ALL!

NOTE: you MUST include original bootstrap first since this file only overrides the mentioned classes.

I may update this if some improvement is needed. for now its working just fine!
If you find any bugs or missing things please dont hesitate to mention it so we can make this better.
